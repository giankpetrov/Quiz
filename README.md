### __Target Audience__

The Quiz is targeted to football fans who also understand english language with a estimated [4 Billion fans](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-are-the-most-popular-sports-in-the-world.html). The Quiz will be used for entertainment but can also be used by those who would like to learn more about FIFA World Cup Tournament.

### __User Stories__

- AS a user, I would like to check the Leaderboard.
- As a user, I would like to be able to see instructions before start the game.
- As a user, I would like to know which is the current question number.
- As a user, I would like to know how many questions are in the Quiz.

- As a user, I would like to see clearly the question and available choices.
- As a user, I would like to see which choice I am in before final selection.

### __Wireframes__

I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create wireframes for the website. 

The original idea was always to demonstrate the capabilities of JavaScript over the DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation. In order to do so, I decide to design the project as one page websites with a single HTML file with multiple sections that will work as different stages or scenarios.
